I was tasked with creating a program for the Computer Science department at ABCU to provide a more efficient way of managing course information. The program loads data from a file containing the school’s course information, stores it in a hash table for quick access, and presents an intuitive menu system for users to interact with. To approach this, I focused on selecting a data structure that would handle the program’s needs efficiently. The hash table was ideal because it allows fast lookups for course details, especially when managing prerequisites. I started by drafting pseudocode to outline the program’s structure, breaking the project into smaller tasks. For example, I built the menu system first and then worked on the functionality of each menu option individually. This modular approach helped me stay organized and made testing each piece much easier.

While working on the project, I faced challenges that taught me important problem-solving skills. One major roadblock was loading the course data file into the program. The file couldn’t be opened, and it took some debugging to figure out why. I added error messages to identify whether the issue was the file’s location or something else. Eventually, I realized the program wasn’t finding the file because of how the path was set. I fixed this by allowing the program to accept an exact file path, and it worked perfectly after that. This process taught me the importance of testing small parts of my code and using clear error messages. It also gave me a better understanding of how to design software that is not only functional but also easy to maintain and improve later. By focusing on clear variable names, comments, and a modular structure, I’ve learned how to write code that’s both readable and adaptable for future changes.
